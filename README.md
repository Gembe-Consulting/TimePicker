# TimePicker
OpenUI5 TimePicker especially for desktop proposes

Those who are familiar with UI5 know, that there is a DatePicker which works very well. However, ther is no equivalent for picking a time value (actually there is a sap.m.TimePicker since version 1.36, but is much more suited to mobile apps).

This DatePicker is based on a sap.ui.commons.ComboBox and provides some functions to display time values. Time value given from the bindable list is formatted into users localized form.
User input is parsed accordingly.

Feel free to use and share.
